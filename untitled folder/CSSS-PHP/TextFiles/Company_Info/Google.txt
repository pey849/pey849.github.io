<b>Google</b>

The name "Google," a play on the word "googol," the mathematical term for a 1 followed by 100 zeros. The name reflects the immense volume of information that exists, and the scope of Google's mission: to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

Google has offices around the globe, but regardless of where we are, we nurture an invigorating, positive environment by hiring talented, people who share our commitment to creating great products. Googlers thrive in small, focused teams and high-energy environments, believe in the ability of technology to change the world, and are as passionate about their lives as they are about their work.

Google Waterloo is a fast growing office with many new exciting projects being developed. We're always on the look-out for new Googlers.
