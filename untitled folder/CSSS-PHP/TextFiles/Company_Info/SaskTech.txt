<b>Saskatoon TechWorks</b>

Saskatoon TechWorks Inc. is a makerspace (or hackerspace) that is focused on science, technology, culture, mechanics and the digital arts. We offer a space where people with diverse backgrounds can socialize, collaborate and learn. Through shared resources, knowledge and ideas we strive to create an atmosphere that promotes community and learning.

We also fulfill our role as a community resource by hosting workshops on electronics, programming, crafts, and any other skills that members (or guests) are willing to share.
